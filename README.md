# Database- Food Factory Management System
Food is the essential needs in our life. After observing many resources, we choose to do our project in “Food Factory Management System”. We found it useful as people don’t know how a food factory works internally. Our purpose is to make people know about the internal management system. We are only in our learning stage, and we tried our best to use as much as information which we learnt these days in our “Introduction to Database” program using Oracle.
